1.1 Develop a program to read the student details like Name, USN, and Marks in three subjects. 
Display the student details, total marks and percentage with suitable messages.


stName = input("Enter the name of the student : ")
stUSN = input("Enter the USN of the student : ")
stMarks1 = int(input("Enter marks in Subject 1 : "))
stMarks2 = int(input("Enter marks in Subject 2 : "))
stMarks3 = int(input("Enter marks in Subject 3 : "))
print("Student Details\n=========================")
print("%12s"%("Name :"), stName)
print("%12s"%("USN :"), stUSN)
print("%12s"%("Marks 1 :"), stMarks1)
print("%12s"%("Marks 2 :"), stMarks2)
print("%12s"%("Marks 3 :"), stMarks3)
print("%12s"%("Total :"), stMarks1+stMarks2+stMarks3)
print("%12s"%("Percent :"), "%.2f"%((stMarks1+stMarks2+stMarks3)/3))
print("=========================")


1.2 Develop a program to read the name and year of birth of a person. Display whether the 
person is a senior citizen or not.

from datetime import date
perName = input("Enter the name of the person : ")
perDOB = int(input("Enter his year of birth : "))
curYear = date.today().year
perAge = curYear - perDOB
if (perAge > 60):
    print(perName, "aged", perAge, "years is a Senior Citizen.")
else:
    print(perName, "aged", perAge, "years is not a Senior Citizen.")

2.1 Develop a program to generate Fibonacci sequence of length (N). Read N from the console.

num = int(input("Enter the Fibonacci sequence length to be generated : "))
firstTerm = 0
secondTerm = 1
print("The Fibonacci series with", num, "terms is :")
print(firstTerm, secondTerm, end=" ")
for i in range(2,num):
    curTerm = firstTerm + secondTerm
    print(curTerm, end=" ")
    firstTerm = secondTerm
    secondTerm = curTerm
    print()


2.2 Write a function to calculate factorial of a number. Develop a program to compute binomial 
 coefficient (Given N and R).

def fact(num):
    if num == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return num * fact(num-1)

n = int(input("Enter the value of N : "))
r = int(input("Enter the value of R (R cannot be negative or greater than N): "))
nCr = fact(n)/(fact(r)*fact(n-r))
print(n,'C',r," = ","%d"%nCr, sep="")


3) 3. Read N numbers from the console and create a list. Develop a program to print mean, variance
and standard deviation with suitable messages.

from math import sqrt
myList = []
num = int(input("Enter the number of elements in your list : "))
for i in range(num):
    val = int(input("Enter the element : "))
    myList.append(val)
    print('The length of list1 is', len(myList))
    print('List Contents', myList)
total = 0
for elem in myList:
    total += elem
    mean = total / num
total = 0
for elem in myList:
    total += (elem - mean) * (elem - mean)
variance = total / num
stdDev = sqrt(variance)
print("Mean =", mean)
print("Variance =", variance)
print("Standard Deviation =", "%.2f"%stdDev)

4. Read a multi-digit number (as chars) from the console. Develop a program to print the frequency of 
each digit with suitable message.

num = input("Enter a number : ")
print("The number entered is :", num)
uniqDig = set(num)
for elem in uniqDig:
    print(elem, "occurs", num.count(elem), "times")

5. Develop a program to print 10 most frequently appearing words in a text file. [Hint: Use dictionary 
with distinct words and their frequency of occurrences. Sort the dictionary in the reverse order of 
frequency and display dictionary slice of first 10 items
